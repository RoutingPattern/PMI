Files containing the geographical information of the road network you want to match your trajectories to are requied:
(1) node file: a comma-separated file cotaining at least three columns: ['node', 'lng', 'lat'], where 'node' is the identification of the breakdown points of your road network, 'lng' and 'lat' the longitudes and latitudes of nodes.
(2) edge file: a comma-separated file cotaining at least three columns: ['edge', 's_node', 'e_node', 's_lng', 's_lat', 'e_lng', 'e_lat', 'c_lng', 'c_lat'], where 'edge' is the identification of the road segments of your road network, 's_node' and 'e_node' the begining nodes and ending nodes of segments, 's_lng', 's_lat' the coordinates of 's_node', 'e_lng', 'e_lat' the coordinates of 'e_node', 'c_lng', 'c_lat' the coordinates of the mid points of edges.
(3) network properties file: a comma-separated file cotaining at least four columns: ['section_id', 's_node', 'e_node', 'length'], where 'section_id' is the identification of the road segments of your road network, 's_node' and 'e_node' the begining nodes and ending nodes of segments, 'length' the lengths of road segments.
The path of above three files should be specified in STmatching_distribution_ver.py.
The trajectory file must be a comma-separated file cotaining at least three columns: ['TRAJ_ID', 'LON', 'LAT'], where 'TRAJ_ID' is the identification of each trajectory.
